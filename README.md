# Landing Page

## Overview

Our task was to create a landing page which contains basic information about Urban Pergola and what has been done by the team during the Community Impact Project. The initial goal was to work on the already existing landing page, but there were a lot of issues regarding the modules that were implemented by the previous team, since they couldn't be accessed locally. Thus, we built a new landing page from scratch using CSS and HTML.

## Main features

- the new landing page includes multiple other pages such as:
  - Contact page
  - Data page
  - Photos page
- our code is structured in separate files, thus outlining a difference between the design of our page and the actual code

### Main page

The main page includes a short description of Urban Pergola and our CIP and the names of our external partners, with a designated picture space for each of them.

### Contact page

For the contact page we created a template that can be used by the following teams to upload contact information about Urban Pergola and the CIP.

### Data page

The data page will include data that was retrieved from the sensor and the analysis that has been made on them.

### Photo page

The photo page includes photos that were taken during the CIP and emphasise the progress that has been made.
