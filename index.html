            Urban Pergola is a young startup for greening urban spaces. We construct planted nets that can be hung in places where 
            greenery is otherwise not possible. Here we provide shade, a cooler urban climate, air purification and the possibility 
            of urban farming. All without restricting other types of use on the ground. In this way, we avoid the prevailing spatial 
            conflict in cities.

            We plant a wide variety of perennial and annual climbing plants, such as lonicera, 
            beans, knotweed, pumpkin, cucumber, bindweed and many more. The plants grow from our specially made plant 
            boxes directly onto the net. We have decided to plant the plants in hydroponics. This means we work without a 
            conventional substrate, but in a hydroponic system made of expanded clay and a water-fertilizer mix.
